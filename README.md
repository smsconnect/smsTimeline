# smsTimeline

##Description
A test article that was in production for the RIT Media Sciences app. It was never finished and is only in a testing stage (but pretty close).

The purpose of this article is to show a timeline of School of Media Sciences events over the years, and allow the user to navigate through the timeline to learn more about the events. Ideally interactive content(images, audio, video etc.) would accompany some of the events on the timeline.

##Article Status
- Article was never published on the RIT Media Sciences app.

##Code Status 
1. A data object exists that creates the starting and ending dates of the timeline and adds events to different years on that timeline; however, it is only what I could find with my own research--Riordan should be consulted and given the final say on the events that should be added or subtracted from the timeline.

2. The timeline is operational--it uses d3 to create the timeline and the event points, and to animate between events. The description of an event is displayed when a user scrolls to that event. Interactive content is only in the testing stages (I added a test image to the first event and a a test audio element to the second event).

###Hayden's Recommendations
- Needs somemore work to properly insert videos, and audio element could probably be styled better than it is now

- Interactive content needs to be tested through the preflight app on devices

- Content area will expand when a user touches it. This is nice for when there is an image or video, but may not be necessary...have to decide if we want to keep this functionality.

- Color and styling of whole article could use some tweaking
